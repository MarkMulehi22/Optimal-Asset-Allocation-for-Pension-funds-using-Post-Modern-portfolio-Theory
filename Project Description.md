Together with my team, we undertook a project titled Optimal asset allocation for Pension Funds using the Post-modern portfolio Theory. We mainly used Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpt to import, clean, and visualize the data of 10 companies listed in the Nairobi Securities Exchange. Post Modern portfolio theory is an improvement on the Modern Portfolio Theory by Harry Markorwitz.
